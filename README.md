# Simple-Python-Keylogger
A simple Python-based keylogger that records keyboard input and logs it to a file for educational and security-learning purposes only.

The author is not responsible for any misuse of this code.     

# Legal and Ethical notice
This tool is intended only for:
- Your own devices that you personally own or have explicit written permission to monitor​
- Educational, testing, or defensive security purposes (for example, understanding how keyloggers work so they can be detected and mitigated)​

# You must:​
- Inform all users of a monitored device and obtain their consent where required by law​
- Comply with all applicable local, state, federal, and international laws. Unauthorized surveillance, credential theft, or privacy invasion may be illegal and can lead to criminal or civil penalties.​

# Features: 
- Logs keystrokes from the keyboard to a local log file (for example, keylog.txt).
- Runs in the background while the system is in use.
- Simple code structure suitable for learning how keylogging works in Python.
- Runs silently in the background without displaying any terminal or console window while capturing keystrokes​

# Requirements:
- Python 3.x installed on the system
- Required Python packages: PyInstaller, and Pynput
- A supported operating system (commonly Windows, Linux, or macOS, depending on the library used)
​

# Install dependencies
- Pynput
- PyInstaller

```
pip install pynput
pip install pyinstaller
```

# Installation
1) Clone or download this repository.
2) Place the keylogger script (keylogger.py) in the desired directory.
3) Install the required Python packages as listed in the Requirements section.
​

# Usage
Logged keys will be written to the configured log file (log.txt) in the same directory or in the specified log path.
​

# Stopping the keylogger:
To terminate the script, hit the ESC key.​

# Security and Privacy Considerations
- Never use this tool on systems without permission or on accounts that are not yours​
- Avoid capturing or storing sensitive data like passwords, personal messages, or financial information whenever possible; if such data is captured during testing, delete logs securely
- Store logs in a secure location and restrict access to authorized users only​
